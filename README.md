This project was created by watching and coding along to MayanWolfe's Twitch video "Let's Make an Auto-Completing Movie Finder App #100Devs"
The project is a full-stack web application where I practiced/learned about the following:
    1.) Get more practice creating a server.js file with access to express, cors, mongodb, ignored files
    2.) Practicing set up through MongoDB site to autocomplete movie titles from a MongoDB sample collection as you type them into an input
    3.) Practice app.get express method and async/await functions with try/catch blocks to get titles as you type, and grab the title and it's associated info when right movie entered
    4.) Practice debugging through dev tools
    5.) Remember to use git ignore to prevent from pushing unnecessary files to GH, and .env to establish another location for variables that I don't want pushed.
